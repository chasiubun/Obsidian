**Athreos's Villains**

| dice: d6 | Villain |
|----------|---------|
| 1 | An [oracle](b_oracle-mot.md) (see "chapter 6") follows omens to find those who have been resurrected, claiming they owe Athreos a debt. |
| 2 | A mercenary ([b_gladiator](b_gladiator.md)) accuses a community of harboring Returned and threatens to claim their leader's life to restore the balance. |
| 3 | A warmongering [b_noble](2.%20GM%20Tools/5eTools%20Compendium%20&%20Rules/z_compendium/bestiary/humanoid/b_noble.md) rallies the public against a necropolis, encouraging a war between the living and the dead. |
| 4 | A group of [cult fanatics](b_cult-fanatic.md) charges exorbitant prices for funeral rites, threatening to lead the dead astray unless they're shown proper respect. |
| 5 | A [b_priest](b_priest.md) of Athreos speaks out against healers and Pharika's followers during a plague, offering death as the only alternative to suffering. |
| 6 | A [lampad](b_lampad-mot.md) (see "chapter 6") hunts the offspring of an ancient hero who escaped death, claiming they shouldn't exist. |
