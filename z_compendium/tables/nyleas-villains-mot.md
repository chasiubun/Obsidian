**Nylea's Villains**

| dice: d6 | Villain |
|----------|---------|
| 1 | A Setessan hunt-leader ([Setessan hoplite](b_setessan-hoplite-mot.md); see "chapter 6") swears vengeance on a poacher in the Nessian Wood who turns out to be an Akroan general. |
| 2 | A [b_hydra](b_hydra.md) goes on a rampage at the edge of the forest. It must be dealt with, but a [b_druid](b_druid.md) follower of Nylea will take vengeance on anyone who kills it outright. |
| 3 | A [b_mage](b_mage.md) who lives in a secluded grove has been using a magic item to transform interlopers into boars. She claims that Nylea gave her this item. |
| 4 | A [b_druid](b_druid.md) uses magic on fields near the border of the forest, creating animated plants to drive off farmers. |
| 5 | A [b_scout](b_scout.md) has taken to hunting and eating sapient beings. What could have caused this gruesome turn? |
| 6 | Those who follow a mysterious green [b_unicorn](2.%20GM%20Tools/5eTools%20Compendium%20&%20Rules/z_compendium/bestiary/celestial/b_unicorn.md) inevitably turn up dead, their bodies entangled in strangling vines. |
