**Mogis's Villains**

| dice: d8 | Villain |
|----------|---------|
| 1 | A petty tyrant ([b_gladiator](b_gladiator.md)) rules his populace through threats and intimidation. His favorite pastime is forcing unwilling subjects to fight in gladiatorial blood sports. |
| 2 | A band of [minotaurs](b_minotaur.md) directed by a champion of Mogis forges a trail of devastation through the countryside. |
| 3 | A serial killer ([b_assassin](b_assassin.md)) stalks the streets of the polis, taking lives seemingly at random. |
| 4 | An [oracle](b_oracle-mot.md) (see "chapter 6") of Mogis marches into town and predicts doom on the populace within a fortnight. |
| 5 | Priests of Iroas and Heliod are being murdered by unknown assailants and their temples desecrated. |
| 6 | An [b_archmage](b_archmage.md) is corrupted by Mogis and begins summoning demons to savage the population. |
| 7 | A badly wounded caravan guard ([bandit captain](b_bandit-captain.md)) accuses the characters of murder and banditry. |
| 8 | A cabal of Mogis's [cult fanatics](b_cult-fanatic.md) have almost succeeded in finding a way to summon Mogis's warhound to their service. |
