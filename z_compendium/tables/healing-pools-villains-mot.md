| 2 | [Naiads](b_naiad-mot.md) (see "chapter 6") guard the pools, making their own judgments about who is and isn't worthy of the pools' healing magic. |
| 3 | The magic waters of the pools wash out to sea and attract a dying [b_kraken](2.%20GM%20Tools/5eTools%20Compendium%20&%20Rules/z_compendium/bestiary/monstrosity/b_kraken.md) to the area. |
| 4 | An [b_assassin](b_assassin.md) barters captured humanoid test subjects for poison from the pools' [b_medusa](b_medusa.md) priest. |
| 5 | A dying [b_veteran](b_veteran.md) who was [poisoned](_conditions.md#poisoned) by the pools slaughters any person who is healed by the waters. |
| 6 | An [oracle](b_oracle-mot.md) (see "chapter 6") allows the pools' poisons to seep from the caves and contaminate a community. |
