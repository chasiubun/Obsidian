**Klothys's Villains**

| dice: d6 | Villain |
|----------|---------|
| 1 | A single-minded Nyxborn [b_assassin](b_assassin.md) of Klothys hunts a hero who was raised from the dead. |
| 2 | Believing in the holiness of a terrible beast, Klothys's [acolytes](2.%20GM%20Tools/5eTools%20Compendium%20&%20Rules/z_compendium/bestiary/humanoid/b_acolyte.md) murder heroes sent to deal with it. |
| 3 | Certain that civilization offends fate, a [b_priest](b_priest.md) raises a herd of [typhons](b_typhon-mot.md) to release on a city. |
| 4 | Insulted [satyr revelers](b_satyr-reveler-mot.md) (see "chapter 6") channel Klothys's magic to drive a polis's priests into embarrassing debauchery. |
| 5 | An [oracle](b_oracle-mot.md) (see "chapter 6") knows it is a character's destiny to serve Klothys. The seer manufactures tragedy for the individual to provoke this revelation. |
| 6 | A [cult fanatic](b_cult-fanatic.md) of Klothys believes that the characters' deeds mark them as servants of the titans, destined to free one of those ancient terrors. |
