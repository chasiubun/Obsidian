## Traits

### Age

Humans reach adulthood in their late teens and live less than a century.

### Size

Humans vary widely in height and build, from barely 5 feet to well over 6 feet tall. Regardless of your position in that range, your size is Medium.

### Languages

You can speak, read, and write Common and one extra language of your choice. Humans typically learn the languages of other peoples they deal with, including obscure dialects. They are fond of sprinkling their speech with words borrowed from other tongues: Orc curses, Elvish musical expressions, Dwarvish military phrases, and so on.

### Artisan's Intuition

When you make an [Arcana](_skills.md#Arcana) check or an ability check involving artisan's tools, you can roll a `d4` and add the number rolled to the ability check.

### Maker's Gift

You gain proficiency with one type of artisan's tools of your choice.

### Spellsmith

You know the [mending](mending.md) cantrip. You can also cast the [magic weapon](magic-weapon.md) spell with this trait. When you do so, the spell lasts for 1 hour and doesn't require [concentration](_conditions.md#concentration). Once you cast the spell with this trait, you can't do so again until you finish a long rest. Intelligence is your spellcasting ability for these spells.

### Spells of the Mark

If you have the Spellcasting or the Pact Magic class feature, the spells on the Mark of Making Spells table are added to the spell list of your spellcasting class.
