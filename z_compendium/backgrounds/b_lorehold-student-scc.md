# Lorehold Student
*Source: Strixhaven: A Curriculum of Chaos p. 31*  

- **Skill Proficiencies.** [History](_skills.md#History), [Religion](_skills.md#Religion)  
- **Languages.** Two of your choice  
- **Equipment.** A [bottle of black ink](ink-1-ounce-bottle.md), an [ink pen](ink-pen.md), a [hammer](hammer.md), a [hooded lantern](hooded-lantern.md), a [tinderbox](tinderbox.md), a tome of history, a school uniform, and a [pouch](pouch.md) containing 15 gp  

You have spent your youth preparing to be a student of Lorehold College, reading every book on the college's recommended reading list for prospective students. Your academic passions are in the broad field of history. You might dream of using magic to contact great historical figures or your own ancestors or of recreating the mighty magic of a distant age.

## Feature: Lorehold Initiate

You gain the [Strixhaven Initiate](strixhaven-initiate-scc.md) feat and must choose Lorehold within it.

In addition, if you have the Spellcasting or Pact Magic feature, the spells on the Lorehold Spells table are added to the spell list of your spellcasting class. (If you are a multiclass character with multiple spell lists, these spells are added to all of them.)

**Lorehold Spells**

| Spell Level | Spells |
|-------------|--------|
| 1st | [Comprehend Languages](comprehend-languages.md), [Identify](identify.md) |
| 2nd | [Borrowed Knowledge](borrowed-knowledge-scc.md), [Locate Object](locate-object.md) |
| 3rd | [Speak with Dead](speak-with-dead.md), [Spirit Guardians](spirit-guardians.md) |
| 4th | [Arcane Eye](arcane-eye.md), [Stone Shape](stone-shape.md) |
| 5th | [Flame Strike](flame-strike.md), [Legend Lore](legend-lore.md) |

Consider customizing how your spells look when you cast them. Your Lorehold spells might create displays of golden light. You might use a tome or a scroll as a spellcasting focus, and your spell effects might reflect the appearance of the reference books you study.

## Building a Lorehold Character

Any class or subclass that deals with knowledge of the past can be a good fit in Lorehold. Bards thrive in Lorehold, and wizards (particularly those of the [School of Divination](wizard-school-of-divination.md)) are numerous among its students. Clerics (often with the [Knowledge](cleric-knowledge-domain.md) or [Light](cleric-light-domain.md) domains) are also quite common.

For a more unusual take on a Lorehold student, you could consider playing a barbarian with a primal connection to the past (perhaps adopting the [Path of the Ancestral Guardian](barbarian-path-of-the-ancestral-guardian-xge.md) from "Xanathar's Guide to Everything") or a paladin whose [Oath of the Ancients](paladin-oath-of-the-ancients.md) gives a concrete link to history.

### Suggested Characteristics

Methodical historians and daring adventurers alike can be found among the ranks of Lorehold college. The Lorehold Personality Traits table suggests a variety of traits you might adopt for your character.

**Lorehold Personality Traits**

| dice: d6 | Personality Trait |
|----------|-------------------|
| 1 | I thrive on esoteric lore. The more obscure the historical references I can include in everyday conversation, the better. |
| 2 | By searching for these lost artifacts, I hope to find who I really am along the way. |
| 3 | I can barely go a minute without talking about my research. I have so much knowledge in my head, and it needs to be let out somewhere! |
| 4 | The spirits of the dead are so much more interesting to talk with than living classmates. |
| 5 | I can speak eloquently about the historical ramifications of an ancient war. But ask me to add two-digit numbers together, and I'm a mess. |
| 6 | In the end, it's all just entropy. Everything falls apart someday. |

### Lorehold Trinkets

When you make your character, you may roll once on the Lorehold Trinkets table, instead of on the [Trinkets table](trinket.md) in the "Player's Handbook", for your starting trinket.
