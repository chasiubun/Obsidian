# Instrument of the Bards, Anstruth Harp
*Instrument, major, very rare (requires attunement by a bard)*  

- **Weight**: 2.0 lbs.

An instrument of the bards is an exquisite example of its kind, superior to an ordinary instrument in every way. Seven types of these instruments exist, each named after a legendary bard college. A creature that attempts to play the instrument without being attuned to it must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or take `2d4` psychic damage.

You can use an action to play the instrument and cast one of its spells. Once the instrument has been used to cast a spell, it can't be used to cast that spell again until the next dawn. The spells use your spellcasting ability and spell save DC.

You can play the instrument while casting a spell that causes any of its targets to be [charmed](_conditions.md#charmed) on a failed saving throw, thereby imposing disadvantage on the save. This effect applies only if the spell has a somatic or a material component.

All instruments of the bards can be used to cast the following spells: [fly](fly.md), [invisibility](invisibility.md), [levitate](levitate.md), and [protection from evil and good](protection-from-evil-and-good.md).

In addition, the Anstruth harp can be used to cast [control weather](control-weather.md), [cure wounds](cure-wounds.md) (5th level), and [wall of thorns](wall-of-thorns.md).
