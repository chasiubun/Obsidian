A ray of sickening greenish energy lashes out toward a creature within range. Make a ranged spell attack against the target.

**Classes**: [Artificer (Alchemist)](artificer-alchemist-tce.md), [Cleric (Death Domain)](cleric-death-domain.md), [Fighter (Eldritch Knight)](fighter-eldritch-knight.md), [Rogue (Arcane Trickster)](rogue-arcane-trickster.md), [Sorcerer](sorcerer.md), [Wizard](wizard.md)
