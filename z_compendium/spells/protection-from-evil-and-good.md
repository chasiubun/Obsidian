# Protection from Evil and Good
*1st-level, Abjuration*  

- **Casting time:** 1 action
- **Range:** Touch
- **Components:** V, S, holy water or powdered silver and iron, which the spell consumes
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 10 minute

Until the spell ends, one willing creature you touch is protected against certain types of creatures: aberrations, celestials, elementals, fey, fiends, and undead.

The protection grants several benefits. Creatures of those types have disadvantage on attack rolls against the target. The target also can't be [charmed](_conditions.md#charmed), [frightened](_conditions.md#frightened), or possessed by them. If the target is already [charmed](_conditions.md#charmed), [frightened](_conditions.md#frightened), or possessed by such a creature, the target has advantage on any new saving throw against the relevant effect.

**Classes**: [Cleric](cleric.md), [Fighter (Eldritch Knight)](fighter-eldritch-knight.md), [Paladin (Oath of Devotion)](paladin-oath-of-devotion.md), [Paladin](paladin.md), [Ranger (Horizon Walker)](ranger-horizon-walker-xge.md), [Ranger (Monster Slayer)](ranger-monster-slayer-xge.md), [Rogue (Arcane Trickster)](rogue-arcane-trickster.md), [Sorcerer (Clockwork Soul)](sorcerer-clockwork-soul-tce.md), [Sorcerer (Divine Soul)](sorcerer-divine-soul-xge.md), [Warlock](warlock.md), [Wizard](wizard.md)
