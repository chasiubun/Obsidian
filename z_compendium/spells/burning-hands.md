# Burning Hands
*1st-level, Evocation*  

- **Casting time:** 1 action
- **Range:** Self (15-feet cone)
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** Instantaneous

As you hold your hands with thumbs touching and fingers spread, a thin sheet of flames shoots forth from your outstretched fingertips. Each creature in a 15-foot cone must make a Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes `3d6` fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

The fire ignites any flammable objects in the area that aren't being worn or carried.

**At Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, the damage increases by 1d6 for each slot level above 1st.

**Classes**: [Cleric (Light Domain)](cleric-light-domain.md), [Druid (Circle of Wildfire)](druid-circle-of-wildfire-tce.md), [Fighter (Eldritch Knight)](fighter-eldritch-knight.md), [Monk (Way of the Sun Soul)](monk-way-of-the-sun-soul-xge.md), [Rogue (Arcane Trickster)](rogue-arcane-trickster.md), [Sorcerer](sorcerer.md), [Warlock (The Fiend)](warlock-the-fiend.md), [Warlock (The Genie)](warlock-the-genie-tce.md), [Wizard](wizard.md)
