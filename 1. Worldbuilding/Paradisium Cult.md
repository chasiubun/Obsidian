The Paradisium Cult discovered relics of the nature of how the world was created. In order to attempt to re-establish what they call the first age, Paradise, the cult seeks to seize control of all civilizations away from the Aspects and to their own. Seeing one Aspect receive a cut from another during one of the Exhibitions, the cult reasoned that although the Aspects no longer aged, they could be injured, subjugated, and even killed. This small, yet effective cult operates undercover in most established societies, growing in control over those who occupy the higher echelons of society.

Members of the cult are cold and calculating as they strive toward their goal. Each is accompanied by a Prism that operates as a weapon and as communication between members. The Prism is an objective tool that keeps each member in check while providing protection. Effects of the Prism also include a mind meld effect of conforming the minds of the members into one hive.
