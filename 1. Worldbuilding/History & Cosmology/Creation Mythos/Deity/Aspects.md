The [[Aspects]]  were selected by the [[Parhelion]] to be caretakers of the world. In the Exhibition that takes place every hundred years, Aspects became more driven by pride and self-interest instead of maintaining the balance and order of creation.

The [[Aspects]] divided, some turning towards isolationism and others turned the Exhibition of mutual benefit to an arms race and display of pride.

Time, Space, Law reside in [[Astrale]] to maintain creation, but to not be involved
Magic/Energy, Dream, and Foresight reside in Miroirs, basking in their power over lesser creatures.
Earth, Ocean, Air, and Flame wander the wilderness to take power not in civilization, but in the natural order
Governance, Justice, Equilibrium occupy spaces among the greater civilizations
Knowledge and Truth remain in isolation, trusting only in the [[owlin-scc]] who document history
Fertility and Decay wander the wilderness and do not mingle with creation
Memory, Emotion, and Focus occupy spaces among the greater civilizations
