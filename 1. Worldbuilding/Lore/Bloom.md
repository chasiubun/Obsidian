# Phenomenon
A phenomenon known as "Bloom" began in the 3rd Age at the arena of the 34th Exhibition. A multitude of flora spontaneously bloom into a perfect golden ratio swirl. Anyone that looks into it for too long descend into a type of madness. Further effects of the bloom can be nullified when any part of the swirl is broken.
# The Swirl
The swirl of Bloom is formed in a perfect golden ratio. The petals of the flowers are sized exactly the same and protrude from the pistil at the exact same degree with no shifting from the wind. If the flora grows on wood, a perfectly, seemingly cut, slice of wood protrudes from the bark.

# The Purpose
Unbeknownst to the current populous, the Bloom is a reaction of creation against its inhabiting creatures. The disarray of creation has caused a reaction seeking to cleanse the earth of its caretaker and to reset to a blank slate.
