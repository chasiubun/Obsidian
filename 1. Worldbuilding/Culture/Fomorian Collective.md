The [[b_fomorian]] collective is a group of monsters who banded together under a truce to oppose the [[Aspects]] and the civilizations they have created. While it is believed certain species are xenophobic or desire to be the one to rule the rest, the collective appears to operate as a unit. Adventurers seeing enemies they never expect to see together, banding to assault the cities they have built up. There is no overt hierarchy or chain of command aside from the stronger ruling the weak. No one appears to know how this collective came to be.
