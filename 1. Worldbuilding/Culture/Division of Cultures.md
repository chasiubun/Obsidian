Many races reside in the land of [[Fontaine]] . In the beginning there were certain races created alongside the animals known as the Primordial. These were the first to walk the earth in the first age. At the end of the first age before the [[Parhelion]] left Fontaine, they created the second set of races who came to be known as the Primeval. It was soon after after the Parhelion departed that many Primordial races withdrew to isolation. As the corruption of order plagued the land due to the misguidance of the [[Aspects]], monsters began to roam the land. Some of these monsters gained higher sentience and built their own civilizations. As time went on, some of these civilizations became recognized as a race of their own, known as the ==PLACEHOLDER==.
