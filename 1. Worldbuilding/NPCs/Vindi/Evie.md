> [!metadata|overview]- Overview 
Evie comes from the east. From her demeanor, itâ€™s likely she was raised in a noble family, but no one knows for sure. When asked, she just smiles and changes the subject. Despite her youth, Evie is a force to be reckoned with on the battlefield.

### Friends:
#### [[Grimden]] 
Evie, who wants everyone's happiness, hopes Grimden, who has an unhappy past, will also find happiness.

With her unique sweetness and healing magic, she helps Grimden overcome the wounds of both his body and mind.

Grimden also fully opens his heart to Evie, who leads him to the light.
#### [[Lethor]] 
From the first meeting, Lesser thought that Evie's Reiki was similar to her own.

Lethor, feeling that even the always cheerful Evie will have wounds that she won't be able to overcome, musters the courage to take a step to getting closer to Evie.

Evie is surprised by Lethor's unexpected behavior, but she holds the hand of the only person who understands her inner self.
