[[Dan-Ah]], the transcendent being that once belonged to the world of spirits, and [[Lethor]] , a human that uses spiritual powers that other humans can't feel. Their meeting was met with with a great surprise and supreme joy for each other, especially for Lethor. Danah, who knows about the concept of death and the afterlife more than anyone, has been a warm comfort for Lethor, who still cannot overcome the shock left by the death of her friend and mentor.
