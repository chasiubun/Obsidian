> [!metadata|overview]- Overview 
> **Hurk**, a mysterious new mercenary, may look like a handsome young adventurer, but he hides a dark secret. He's often found in the shadowy corners of inns, brooding over a mug of ale. Other warriors know to avoid him- Hurk's temper is short, and sparking it means signing your own death warrant. When he hears the sound of steel clashing against steel, Hurk becomes a bloodthirsty berserker. With his mighty greatsword, Hurk has been known to chop enemies in half, and cut through hordes of Fomors in a heartbeat.

Wandering the East in search of a new weapon, Hurk stayed at Miri's house for a while, helping Miri's brother in the process.

Even after Hurk's sudden departure, Miri never stopped admiring Hurk's strength and confidence.

Of course, Hurk who doesn't remember people by their names, and remembers Miri, whom he met again in Colhen, as a girl with unusual looks.
