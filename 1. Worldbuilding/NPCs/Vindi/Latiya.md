### Friends:
[[Letty]] 
Latiya, a knight who runs towards danger to protect others... Letty, a gunner who runs towards danger for the thrill of it...

Latiya can not stand by and watch Letty run roughshod over others, so she follows Letty over hill and dale.

Letty needs an actual human friend, and Latiya inadvertently becomes that to her.

Their understanding of each other begins to grow as they both end up destroying their surroundings.

The two are not compatible by any means...

...yet their constant game of cat and mouse is starting to make them depend upon one another.
