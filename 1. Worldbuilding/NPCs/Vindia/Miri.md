> [!metadata|overview]- Overview 
> **Miri** may look like a normal girl, but in reality she's quite different. In her veins flows the blood of powerful, ancient dragons. She always dreamed of a normal life, but destiny brought her to the battlefield. When she was a child, Miri lived in the city and played with all the other children. But the children spoke of her in hushed whispers. Miri was- for them- very strange. She wanted to be normal- she tried so hard. That was until, one day in the forest, Miri heard a strange voice. Although she ignored the voice for some time, she couldn't ignore her fate forever. Eventually, in the forest where the voice was so loud, she discovered the mysterious weapon **Dragonspine,** which spoke to her- and showed Miri the way to her true calling as a mercenary.
