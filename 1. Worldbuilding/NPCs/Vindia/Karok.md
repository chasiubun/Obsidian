> [!metadata|overview]- Overview 
> Karok hails from the Herdlands, a mysterious plain far to the south of Colhen and Rocheste. Only fragments of legends come from that part of the world, tales of a mysterious race of nomadic giants slow to anger yet terrible when their ire is raised. Indeed, prior to his arrival, many “sophisticated” northerners scoffed at tales of giants. Now that Karok walks among them, his presence raises almost as many questions as answers. Why is he here? Why has he thrown in his lot with the people of Colhen and Rocheste? Where are the rest of his people? Karok himself provides no answers. While he is reserved, he is by no means unfriendly. Give him a smile and he’ll offer one in return. Chat with him about the weather, the war, or the finer points of battle technique and he’s as garrulous as the next man. Ask him about his past or where he comes from though, and you’ll be pushed off with that same smile and silence.

#### [[Delia]] 
Leaving behind the life at the palace of her kingdom, Delia arrived at the Giant's village in Kaiman Forest, where she learned the Giant's way of fighting. She met Karok in Colhen's Mercenary Office shortly after.

Karok recognizes Delia as his "friend" and considers her to be cute. Delia also recognizes him as an excellent warrior and they became close.

Except for the moments when she's called "friend".
