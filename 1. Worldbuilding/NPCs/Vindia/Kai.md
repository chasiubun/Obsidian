> [!metadata|overview]- Overview 
> Kai is a brilliant archer driven by strong morals and a troubled past. When others would retreat, Kai rushes head-on into battle, flinging arrows with the ferocity of a madman. Little of Kai's past is known for sure, but rumor has it that his motivation to destroy the Fomors comes from the loss of a loved one.

#### [[Vella]] 
Kai and Vella's reunion was a pure coincidence.

In the past, they had only once joined forces against vampires to achieve their goals. Neither of them thought they would meet again.

When Vella once again met with Kai's cold and indifferent expression, Vella's got a new goal in her mind.

To bring that very man to his knees.
