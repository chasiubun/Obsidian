> [!metadata|overview]- Overview 
> **Grimden**Â is a deadly assassin. The unbearable pain he experienced through his childhood has hardened his heart, gradually making him detached from the rest of the world. His excruciatingly painful childhood turned the once pure-souled child into the ice-cold assassin he is today. He was kidnapped as a child from his family. The kidnappers made from him a weapon that kills without emotion. One day, when saved by a kindly old woman, he falls into trouble. He must decide if must kill his adoptive grandmother or his teacher. In the end, he makes the right decision and becomes free. The only thing that bothers him now is the past. Although he desired to change his behaviour and not kill, he finally realized- the past can't change, but future can. So began his new life.
