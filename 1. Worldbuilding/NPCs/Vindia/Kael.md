#### [[Delia]] 
Kael's and Delia's kingdoms are geographically contiguous neighbors. Kael, who was renowned in his own kingdom at that time as the knight, was once mentioined as the sole candidate for the hand of Queen Delia.

After various twists and turns, the two met in Colhen as mercenaries, not being held back by their statuses of a royalty and a noble. Surprised by each other's bold moves, Kael and Delia became friends rather quickly, sharing their own beliefs with one another.
