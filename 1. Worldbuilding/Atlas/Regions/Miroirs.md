Assumed to be a part of a mirror dimension, Miroirs is in the same space as Reverie. When one sails off the edge of the world, they will fall off and may notice the underbelly of [[Reverie]] contains another land with its own world teeming with life, [[Miroirs]] . With the right technique, they can enter the field of gravity of this world.

Miroirs is a world where the fey reside, teeming with magic. The setting is colorful and vibrant except for the pitch black void above them. Great creatures will conjure colorful clouds in the sky to illuminate what isn't already bright in the land below. A sun-like orb levitates around the world to give it light. The land derives its landscapes and landmarks based off what occurs in Reverie. Where there was ocean in Reverie, there is land, and where there was land, there are great lakes in Miroirs. Instead of the great Skyfall pouring from the heavens, there is a great mountain that extends into the black void above.
