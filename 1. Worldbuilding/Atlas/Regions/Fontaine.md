The world of [[Fontaine]] is shaped like a fountain. A great waterfall descends from [[Astrale]], the heavenly realms into the surface world of [[Reverie]]. Reverie features two great landmasses surrounded by ocean. If one were to "fall off" the edge of the world, they would either descend into  [[Void]] or for those who notice it or are prepared for it, can float with air mobility towards the land of [[Miroirs]],  on the underbelly of Reverie. The earthly body of Fontaine is known as [[UnderMont]] where some races dwell within the depths of the earth.
