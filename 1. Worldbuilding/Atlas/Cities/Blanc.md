## Background
The metropolis of Blanc stands in stark contrast to [[Noir]]. While it is also welcoming of other races, it enforces ideals the Founder deemed necessary and important for a society that seeks to unite all races without a descent into chaos. While the races are united, many critics state that the cultures unique to each race became irrelevant and sacrificed for the sake of conformity.
