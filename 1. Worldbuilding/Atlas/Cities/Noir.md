## Background
In ages past, [[Noir]] was a bustling metropolis welcoming of every race and creed. Its goal was to bring together the races in unity and harmony. However, in attempt to unite the ideals of every race, the city had no foundation of ideals and morals. Immorality and dark dealings grew rampant and the democratic system that governs the city now only barely holds it together. Many travel to this city for the freedoms it affords, even at the expense of one group over another.
