## Twilight Desert
The guild seek a stone that generates miracles and track it with a buoy that lands on a desert island. The island is filled with undead and reapers who have a strange relic box in their possession. Inside the box is a mask shaped like a human face.

Lizardfolk used to be enslaved by the long dead inhabitants of the desert ruins. The mask belongs to the long dead civilization and bears the soul of Havan. A woman in a red robe dwells around the desert seeking her beloved. By using the mask and speaking to the reapers, the party finds out the history of the island. The king of this civilization's daughter, Iset fell in love with a royal guard, Havan. The king killed the guard and the princess comitted suicide.

A new generation of lizardfolk who used to be enslaved now control the island after the king died. They escaped underground and abandoned the kingdom during famine, leaving the civilians to attempt to cultivate the land themselves.

## Misty Summit

The Misty Summit is a treasure trove of iron ore and other precious metals desirable by Rocheste. The land is infested with monsters and hostile wooden humanoids. The mines house crystals that can hold magic. These power the wood men. The Mine used to be a divine mountain and the crystals held divine power.  Gremlins now occupy the mountain and use the crystals to power new biomechanical creatures.
