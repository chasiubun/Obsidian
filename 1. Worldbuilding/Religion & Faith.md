## Origin

All creation was created by one creator (Sol) as a display of the artistry of fittingness, the beauty of order. The one creator divided itself into 8 partitions (Parhelions) who although are incarnated into separate bodies, share one mind and one will together. These 8 formed the society and civilizations of all the races to operate together in harmony and clockwork. Each working in a balance of unity and healthy competition to work with one another and to bring up their respective cultures. The partitions appointed certain individuals called Aspects and bestowed upon them Creative Powers to maintain creation. The Partitions departed and the Aspects were left to continue ruling society.

Every century, there is an Exhibition where each culture showcases the greatest of their achievements to be shared with the world for mutual benefit. Yet, in pride and desire to be the top and pinnacle of creation, the Exhibition turned into ____. Many Aspects pulled out of the Exhibition and turned towards isolationism. Others maintained the Exhibition, but used it as an Arena, creating an arms race. Creation was thrown into a chaotic disarray.
