# Familiars
*Source: Volo's Guide to Monsters p. 213* 

Any spellcaster that can cast the [find familiar](find-familiar.md) spell (such as an apprentice, warlock, or wizard) is likely to have a familiar. The familiar can be one of the creatures described in the spell (see the "Player's Handbook") or some other Tiny monster, such as a [cranium rat](b_cranium-rat-mpmm.md), a [crawling claw](b_crawling-claw.md), a [gazer](b_gazer-mpmm.md), an [b_imp](b_imp.md), a [b_pseudodragon](b_pseudodragon.md), or a [b_quasit](b_quasit.md).
