**Underworld Crossings Villains**

| dice: d6 | Villain |
|----------|---------|
| 1 | A [Returned palamnite](compendium/bestiary/undead/returned-palamnite-mot.md) (see "chapter 6") seeks to destroy all Underworld crossings so the dead can freely enter the mortal world. |
| 2 | A conquering general captures a number of [Underworld cerberi](b_underworld-cerberus-mot.md) (see "chapter 6"), plotting to unleash the terrifying beasts during a war. |
| 3 | A greedy [b_priest](b_priest.md) of Erebos steals coins from the dead before they are buried, thereby filling a crossing with stranded souls. |
| 4 | A [nightmare shepherd](b_nightmare-shepherd-mot.md) (see "chapter 6") takes over a crossing and doesn't allow souls to pass into the Underworld. As a result, they become [specters](compendium/bestiary/undead/specter.md) that harass the living in the mortal world. |
| 5 | A [b_priest](b_priest.md) of Athreos becomes annoyed with the dead returning and sends armies of clergy to secure the mortal side of the crossing. |
| 6 | A [satyr reveler](b_satyr-reveler-mot.md) (see "chapter 6") seeks to throw an eternal revel! By stealing coins from the dead, the satyr traps souls at his morbid, Tartyx-side bacchanal. |
