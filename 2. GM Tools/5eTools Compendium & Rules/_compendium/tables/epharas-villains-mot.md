|----------|---------|
| 1 | A neighborhood leader enacts punitive laws, preventing people from expressing themselves. |
| 2 | A [b_guard](b_guard.md) imprisons people who worship gods opposed to Ephara, such as Phenax and Nylea. |
| 3 | A [b_noble](2.%20GM%20Tools/5eTools%20Compendium%20&%20Rules/_compendium/bestiary/humanoid/b_noble.md) is building a new development directly in a forest, where it will displace wildlife that has lived there for millennia. |
| 4 | A [soldier](b_soldier-ggr.md) begins killing people who have committed terrible crimes but have been acquitted because of loopholes in the judicial system. |
| 5 | A group of [mages](b_mage.md) who follow Ephara want to build a city on an island, heedless of the current residents. |
| 6 | An [oracle](b_oracle-mot.md) (see "chapter 6") leads a cadre of scholars secretly destroying work that they deem antithetical to proper society. |
