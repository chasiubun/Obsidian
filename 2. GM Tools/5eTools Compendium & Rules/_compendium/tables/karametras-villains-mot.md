**Karametra's Villains**

| dice: d6 | Villain |
|----------|---------|
| 1 | The head of an orphanage ([b_commoner](b_commoner.md)) believes she can care for the city's children better than their parents and works to have the other adults arrested. |
| 2 | A [b_priest](b_priest.md) begins imposing restrictive lifestyle rules on a nearby population in order to "civilize" them. |
| 3 | A local leader ([Setessan hoplite](b_setessan-hoplite-mot.md); see "chapter 6") imposes harsh penalties on the poor, claiming their poverty is a sign they have invited the gods' wrath. |
| 4 | The head of a prominent family ([b_noble](2.%20GM%20Tools/5eTools%20Compendium%20&%20Rules/_compendium/bestiary/humanoid/b_noble.md)) continues to exert abusive control over their adult children, citing their role as matriarch or patriarch to justify it. |
