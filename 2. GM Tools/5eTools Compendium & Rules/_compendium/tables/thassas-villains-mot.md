**Thassa's Villains**

| dice: d6 | Villain |
|----------|---------|
| 1 | A [triton master of waves](b_triton-master-of-waves-mot.md) (see "chapter 6") demands ever greater sacrifices to Thassa from merchants moving along a crucial trade route, threatening to sink ships that don't comply. |
| 2 | A former [b_priest](b_priest.md) of Thassa kidnaps indigents and plans to drown them as offerings to regain her favor. |
| 3 | A [b_druid](b_druid.md) of Thassa, after being mistreated by a coastal community, uses magic to lure a plague of [giant crabs](b_giant-crab.md) out of the depths to take revenge. |
| 4 | A [water elemental](b_water-elemental.md) is trapped in a village well and has changed the drinking water to saltwater. It needs help returning to the sea. |
| 5 | Sirens (see the harpies entry in "chapter 6") favored by Thassa take up residence in a lighthouse, preventing its use. |
| 6 | A ship carrying a massive pearl sacred to Thassa has been sunk. Thassa's [cultists](b_cultist.md) want the pearl back, but anyone trying to retrieve it find that the god's triton followers have claimed it. |
