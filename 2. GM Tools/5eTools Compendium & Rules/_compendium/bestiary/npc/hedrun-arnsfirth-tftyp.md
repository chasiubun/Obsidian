## Traits

***Sunlight Sensitivity.*** While in sunlight, Hedrun has disadvantage on attack rolls, as well as on Wisdom ([Perception](rules/skills.md#Perception)) checks that rely on sight.

***Innate Spellcasting.*** Hedrun's innate spellcasting ability is Charisma (spell save DC 13). It can innately cast the following spells, requiring no verbal or material components:

**At will**: [detect magic](compendium/spells/detect-magic.md), [disguise self](compendium/spells/disguise-self.md), [mage armor](compendium/spells/mage-armor.md)

**1/day each**: [fear](compendium/spells/fear.md), [hold person](compendium/spells/hold-person.md), [misty step](compendium/spells/misty-step.md)

## Actions

***Multiattack.*** Hedrun attacks twice with Grave Bolt.

***Grave Bolt.*** *Ranged Spell Attack:* +5 to hit, range 120 ft., one target. *Hit:* 7 (`1d8 + 3`) necrotic damage.

***Life Drain.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +4 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. *Hit:* 9 (`2d6 + 2`) necrotic damage. The target must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or its hit point maximum is reduced by an amount equal to the damage taken. This reduction lasts until the target finishes a long rest. The target dies if this effect reduces its hit point maximum to 0.

A humanoid slain by this attack rises 24 hours later as a [zombie](compendium/bestiary/undead/zombie.md) under Hedrun's control, unless the humanoid is restored to life or its body is destroyed. Hedrun can have no more than twelve [zombies](compendium/bestiary/undead/zombie.md) under its control at one time.
