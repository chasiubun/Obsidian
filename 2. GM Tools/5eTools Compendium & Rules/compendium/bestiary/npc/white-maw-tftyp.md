White Maw can eat through 2-inch-thick, nonmagical metal in 1 round.

***False Appearance.*** While White Maw remains motionless, it is indistinguishable from white stone.

***Killer Response.*** Any creature that starts its turn in White Maw's space is targeted by a pseudopod attack if White Maw isn't [incapacitated](rules/conditions.md#incapacitated).

## Actions

***Pseudopod.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +8 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. *Hit:* 22 (`4d8 + 4`) bludgeoning damage plus 9 (`2d8`) acid damage. If the target is wearing nonmagical metal armor, its armor is partly corroded and takes a permanent and cumulative −1 penalty to the AC it offers. The armor is destroyed if the penalty reduces its AC to 10.
