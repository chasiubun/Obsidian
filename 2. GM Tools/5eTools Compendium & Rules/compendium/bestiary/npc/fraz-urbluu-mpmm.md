# Fraz-Urb'luu
*Source: Mordenkainen Presents: Monsters of the Multiverse p. 129, Mordenkainen's Tome of Foes p. 146*  

Fraz-Urb'luu is the Prince of [Deception](/compendium/rules/skills.md#Deception) and Demon Lord of Illusions. He uses every trick, every ounce of demonic cunning, to manipulate his enemies—mortal and Fiend alike—to do his will. Fraz-Urb'luu can create dreamlands and mind-bending fantasies able to deceive the most discerning foes.

Once imprisoned for centuries below Castle Greyhawk on the world of Oerth, Fraz-Urb'luu has slowly rebuilt his power in the Abyss. He seeks the pieces of the legendary [staff of power](/compendium/items/staff-of-power.md) taken from him by those who imprisoned him and commands his servants to do likewise.

The Prince of [Deception](/compendium/rules/skills.md#Deception)'s true form is like that of a great gargoyle, some 12 feet tall, with an extended, muscular neck; a smiling face framed by long, pointed ears and lank, dark hair; and bat-like wings are furled against his powerful shoulders. He can assume other forms, however, from the hideous to the beautiful.

Many of the cultists of Fraz-Urb'luu aren't even aware they serve the Prince of [Deception](/compendium/rules/skills.md#Deception), believing their master is a beneficent being and granter of wishes, some lost god or Celestial, or even another Fiend. Fraz-Urb'luu wears all these masks and more. He particularly delights in aiding demon-hunters against his demonic adversaries, driving the hunters to greater and greater atrocities in the name of their cause, only to eventually reveal his true nature and claim their souls as his own.

## Fraz-Urb'luu's Lair

Corkscrew towers loom above twisted domes and vast amphitheaters, forming a surreal and disorienting cityscape.

The challenge rating of Fraz-Urb'luu is 24 (62,000 XP) when he's encountered in his lair.
