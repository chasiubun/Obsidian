## Traits

***False Appearance.*** While Turlang remains motionless, it is indistinguishable from a normal tree.

***Siege Monster.*** The treant deals double damage to objects and structures.

***Spellcasting.*** Turlang casts one of the following spells, requiring no material spell components and using Wisdom as the spellcasting ability (spell save DC 15):

**At will**: [druidcraft](/compendium/spells/druidcraft.md), [guidance](/compendium/spells/guidance.md), [resistance](/compendium/spells/resistance.md), [speak with plants](/compendium/spells/speak-with-plants.md)

**1/day each**: [commune with nature](/compendium/spells/commune-with-nature.md) (cast as 1 action), [conjure woodland beings](/compendium/spells/conjure-woodland-beings.md), [hallucinatory terrain](/compendium/spells/hallucinatory-terrain.md) (cast as 1 action)

**2/day each**: [animal messenger](/compendium/spells/animal-messenger.md), [detect magic](/compendium/spells/detect-magic.md), [entangle](/compendium/spells/entangle.md), [goodberry](/compendium/spells/goodberry.md), [gust of wind](/compendium/spells/gust-of-wind.md), [pass without trace](/compendium/spells/pass-without-trace.md), [speak with animals](/compendium/spells/speak-with-animals.md)

## Actions

***Multiattack.*** The treant makes two slam attacks.

***Slam.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +10 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 16 (`3d6 + 6`) bludgeoning damage.

***Rock.*** *Ranged Weapon Attack:* +10 to hit, range 60/180 ft., one target. *Hit:* 28 (`4d10 + 6`) bludgeoning damage.

***Animate Trees (1/Day).*** The treant magically animates one or two trees it can see within 60 feet of it. These trees have the same statistics as a [treant](/compendium/bestiary/plant/treant.md), except they have Intelligence and Charisma scores of 1, they can't speak, and they have only the Slam action option. An animated tree acts as an ally of Turlang. The tree remains animate for 1 day or until it dies; until Turlang dies or is more than 120 feet from the tree; or until Turlang takes a bonus action to turn it back into an inanimate tree. The tree then takes root if possible.
