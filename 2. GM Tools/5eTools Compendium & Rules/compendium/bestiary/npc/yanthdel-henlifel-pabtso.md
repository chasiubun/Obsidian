## Traits

***Fey Ancestry.*** Yanthdel has advantage on saving throws against being [charmed](/compendium/rules/conditions.md#charmed), and magic can't put Yanthdel to sleep.

***Sunlight Sensitivity.*** While in sunlight, Yanthdel has disadvantage on attack rolls, as well as on Wisdom ([Perception](/compendium/rules/skills.md#Perception)) checks that rely on sight.

***Innate Spellcasting.*** Yanthdel's spellcasting ability is Charisma (spell save DC 12). It can innately cast the following spells, requiring no material components:

**At will**: [dancing lights](/compendium/spells/dancing-lights.md)

**1/day each**: [darkness](/compendium/spells/darkness.md), [faerie fire](/compendium/spells/faerie-fire.md), [levitate](/compendium/spells/levitate.md) (self only)

## Actions

***Multiattack.*** Yanthdel makes two shortsword attacks.

***Shortsword.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +7 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 7 (`1d6 + 4`) piercing damage plus 10 (`3d6`) poison damage.

***Hand Crossbow.*** *Ranged Weapon Attack:* +7 to hit, range 30/120 ft., one target. *Hit:* 7 (`1d6 + 4`) piercing damage, and the target must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or be [poisoned](/compendium/rules/conditions.md#poisoned) for 1 hour. If the saving throw fails by 5 or more, the target is also [unconscious](/compendium/rules/conditions.md#unconscious) while [poisoned](/compendium/rules/conditions.md#poisoned) in this way. The target wakes up if it takes damage or if another creature takes an action to shake it awake.

## Reactions

***Parry.*** Yanthdel adds 3 to its AC against one melee attack that would hit it. To do so, Yanthdel must see the attacker and be wielding a melee weapon.
