## Traits

***Festering Aura (Putrid Only).*** Any creature, other than you, that starts its turn within 5 feet of the spirit must succeed on a Constitution saving throw against your spell save DC or be [poisoned](/compendium/rules/conditions.md#poisoned) until the start of its next turn.

## Actions

***Deathly Touch (Ghostly Only).*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* the summoner's spell attack modifier to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. *Hit:* `1d8 + 3 + summonSpellLevel` necrotic damage, and the creature must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw against your spell save DC or be [frightened](/compendium/rules/conditions.md#frightened) of the undead until the end of the target's next turn.

***Grave Bolt (Skeletal Only).*** *Ranged Spell Attack:* the summoner's spell attack modifier to hit, range 150 ft., one target. *Hit:* `2d4 + 3 + summonSpellLevel` necrotic damage.
