# Devkarin Lich
*Source: Guildmasters' Guide to Ravnica p. 198*  

Powerful spellcasters of the Devkarin elves, steeped in Golgari magic, can transcend death to become liches. For them, life and death don't merely chase each other in an inevitable cycle; the two can intersect, and at that nexus the liches find immense power, which commands the awe, envy, and fear of other Golgari.

Unlike the shambling zombies they command, liches retain their memories, their personalities, and especially their ambition. They also retain the grace and stature of living elves, but their bodies are in a constant state of slow decay. Various forms of fungus grow in and over the rotting flesh to hold the body together.

## Undead Nature

The lich doesn't require air, food, drink, or sleep.

## Traits

***Legendary Resistance (3/Day).*** If the lich fails a saving throw, it can choose to succeed instead.

***Regeneration.*** The lich regains 10 hit points at the start of its turn. If the lich takes fire or radiant damage, this trait doesn't function at the start of the lich's next turn. The lich dies only if it starts its turn with 0 hit points and doesn't regenerate.

***Turn Resistance.*** The lich has advantage on saving throws against any effect that turns undead.

***Undead Fortitude.*** If damage reduces the lich to 0 hit points, it must make a Constitution saving throw with a DC of 5 + the damage taken, unless the damage is radiant or from a critical hit. On a success, the lich drops to 1 hit point instead.
