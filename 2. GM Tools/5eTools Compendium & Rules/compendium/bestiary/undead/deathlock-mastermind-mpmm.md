# Deathlock Mastermind
*Source: Mordenkainen Presents: Monsters of the Multiverse p. 87, Mordenkainen's Tome of Foes p. 129*  

Though deathlocks exist to serve their patrons, they retain some freedom when it comes to devising tactics and carrying out plans. Powerful deathlocks recruit lesser creatures to help them carry out their missions, becoming the masterminds behind vast conspiracies and intrigues that culminate in the accomplishment of great acts of evil.

## Deathlocks

The forging of a pact between a warlock and a patron is no minor occasionâ€”at least not for the warlock. The consequences of breaking that pact can be dire and, in some cases, lethal. A warlock who fails to live up to a bargain with an evil patron runs the risk of rising from the dead as a deathlock, a foul Undead driven to serve its otherworldly patron.

An powerful necromancer might also discover the wicked methods of creating a deathlock and then subjugate it, acting as the deathlock's patron.

***Grave Bolt.*** *Ranged Spell Attack:* +6 to hit, range 120 ft., one target. *Hit:* 13 (`3d8`) necrotic damage. If the target is Large or smaller, it must succeed on a DC 16 Strength saving throw or become [restrained](/compendium/rules/conditions.md#restrained) as shadowy tendrils wrap around it for 1 minute. A [restrained](/compendium/rules/conditions.md#restrained) target can use its action to repeat the saving throw, ending the effect on itself on a success.
