## Traits

***Aberrant Form.*** The zealot exudes the chaos of the Far Realm. Any non-Aberration creature that starts its turn within 5 feet of the zealot must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or take 7 (`2d6`) psychic damage.

***Weirdly Pliable.*** The zealot, along with any equipment it is wearing or carrying, is unnaturally flexible. The zealot can move through any space as narrow as 1 inch without squeezing.

***Spellcasting (Psionics).*** The zealot casts one of the following spells, requiring no components and using Charisma as the spellcasting ability (spell save DC 15):

**At will**: [detect thoughts](/compendium/spells/detect-thoughts.md), [minor illusion](/compendium/spells/minor-illusion.md)

**1/day each**: [arcane gate](/compendium/spells/arcane-gate.md), [hunger of Hadar](/compendium/spells/hunger-of-hadar.md)

## Actions

***Multiattack.*** The zealot makes one Psychic Rend attack and two Shortsword attacks.

***Psychic Rend.*** *Melee or Ranged Spell Attack:* +7 to hit, reach 15 ft. or range 120 ft., one target. *Hit:* 14 (`3d6 + 4`) psychic damage, and the target must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or have the [stunned](/compendium/rules/conditions.md#stunned) condition until the start of the zealot's next turn.

***Shortsword.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +7 to hit, reach 15 ft., one target. *Hit:* 7 (`1d6 + 4`) piercing damage plus 7 (`2d6`) psychic damage.

***Mind Blast (Recharge 5-6).*** The zealot magically emits psychic energy in a 60-foot cone. Each creature in that area must succeed on a DC 15 Intelligence saving throw or take 22 (`4d8 + 4`) psychic damage and have the [stunned](/compendium/rules/conditions.md#stunned) condition for 1 minute. A target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the [stunned](/compendium/rules/conditions.md#stunned) condition on itself on a success.

## Bonus Actions

***Void Warp (Recharge 5-6).*** The zealot teleports, along with any equipment it is wearing or carrying, to an unoccupied space it can see within 120 feet of itself, leaving a churning void in the space it left. Immediately after it teleports, each creature within 30 feet of the void other than the zealot must make a DC 15 Strength saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 18 (`4d8`) force damage and is pulled to the unoccupied space closest to the void. On a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage only. The void then disappears.
