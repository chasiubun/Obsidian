# Danoth's Visor (Dormant)
*Wondrous Item, legendary (requires attunement)*  

- **Properties**: Vestige

These mithral-frame goggles with clear diamond lenses were used by the evoker Danoth Oro to spot [invisible](2.%20GM%20Tools/Misc%20DND%20Handbook/compendium/rules/conditions.md#invisible) enemies and scout areas from afar.

## Dormant

While wearing the goggles in their dormant state, you can see normally in darkness, both magical and nonmagical, to a distance of 60 feet. Additionally, you have advantage on Intelligence ([Investigation](/compendium/rules/skills.md#Investigation)) and Wisdom ([Perception](/compendium/rules/skills.md#Perception)) checks that rely on sight.
