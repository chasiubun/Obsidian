# Ring of Free Action
*Ring, major, rare (requires attunement)*  


While you wear this ring, difficult terrain doesn't cost you extra movement. In addition, magic can neither reduce your speed nor cause you to be [paralyzed](2.%20GM%20Tools/Misc%20DND%20Handbook/compendium/rules/conditions.md#paralyzed) or [restrained](2.%20GM%20Tools/Misc%20DND%20Handbook/compendium/rules/conditions.md#restrained).
