# Truth Serum
*Adventuring Gear, poison*  

- **Cost**: 150 gp

A creature subjected to this poison must succeed on a DC 11 Constitution saving throw or become [poisoned](2.%20GM%20Tools/Misc%20DND%20Handbook/compendium/rules/conditions.md#poisoned) for 1 hour. The [poisoned](2.%20GM%20Tools/Misc%20DND%20Handbook/compendium/rules/conditions.md#poisoned) creature can't knowingly speak a lie, as if under the effect of a [zone of truth](/compendium/spells/zone-of-truth.md) spell.
