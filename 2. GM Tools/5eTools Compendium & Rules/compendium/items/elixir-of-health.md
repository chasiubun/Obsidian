# Elixir of Health
*Potion, minor, rare*  


When you drink this potion, it cures any disease afflicting you, and it removes the [blinded](/compendium/rules/conditions.md#blinded), [deafened](/compendium/rules/conditions.md#deafened), [paralyzed](/compendium/rules/conditions.md#paralyzed), and [poisoned](/compendium/rules/conditions.md#poisoned) conditions. The clear red liquid has tiny bubbles of light in it.
