|----------|---------|
| 1 | A group of [Returned palamnites](compendium/bestiary/undead/returned-palamnite-mot.md) (see "chapter 6") invade the pools, believing the waters' magic can restore their lost memories and mortal bodies. |
| 2 | [Naiads](compendium/bestiary/fey/naiad-mot.md) (see "chapter 6") guard the pools, making their own judgments about who is and isn't worthy of the pools' healing magic. |
| 3 | The magic waters of the pools wash out to sea and attract a dying [kraken](compendium/bestiary/monstrosity/kraken.md) to the area. |
| 4 | An [assassin](compendium/bestiary/humanoid/assassin.md) barters captured humanoid test subjects for poison from the pools' [medusa](compendium/bestiary/monstrosity/medusa.md) priest. |
| 5 | A dying [veteran](compendium/bestiary/humanoid/veteran.md) who was [poisoned](rules/conditions.md#poisoned) by the pools slaughters any person who is healed by the waters. |
| 6 | An [oracle](compendium/bestiary/humanoid/oracle-mot.md) (see "chapter 6") allows the pools' poisons to seep from the caves and contaminate a community. |
