| 2 | A secret cabal of Phenax [cult fanatics](compendium/bestiary/humanoid/cult-fanatic.md) infiltrates the temple and uses details learned in private counseling sessions to blackmail worshipers. |
| 3 | An [adult blue dragon](compendium/bestiary/dragon/adult-blue-dragon.md), scarred by a champion of Heliod, seeks to destroy all sun temples in the hopes of bringing about everlasting night. |
| 4 | A corrupt [oracle](compendium/bestiary/humanoid/oracle-mot.md) (see "chapter 6") of Heliod sells counterfeit heroic artifacts to those he can't see as being destined for greatness. |
| 5 | A lazy [priest](compendium/bestiary/humanoid/priest.md) of Heliod risks bringing the god's wrath down upon the entire temple. |
| 6 | An [archmage](compendium/bestiary/humanoid/archmage.md) devoted to Heliod has created a second sun, one which endlessly illuminates the land and burns those she considers wicked. |
