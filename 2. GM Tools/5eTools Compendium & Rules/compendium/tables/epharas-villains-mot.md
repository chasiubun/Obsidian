| 1 | A neighborhood leader enacts punitive laws, preventing people from expressing themselves. |
| 2 | A [guard](compendium/bestiary/humanoid/guard.md) imprisons people who worship gods opposed to Ephara, such as Phenax and Nylea. |
| 3 | A [noble](compendium/bestiary/humanoid/noble.md) is building a new development directly in a forest, where it will displace wildlife that has lived there for millennia. |
| 4 | A [soldier](compendium/bestiary/humanoid/soldier-ggr.md) begins killing people who have committed terrible crimes but have been acquitted because of loopholes in the judicial system. |
| 5 | A group of [mages](compendium/bestiary/humanoid/mage.md) who follow Ephara want to build a city on an island, heedless of the current residents. |
