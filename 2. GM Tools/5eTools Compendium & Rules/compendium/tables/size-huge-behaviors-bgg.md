| dice: d8 | Behavior |
|----------|----------|
| 1 | The giant has a pet (a [panther](/compendium/bestiary/beast/panther.md), a [wolf](/compendium/bestiary/beast/wolf.md), or a [giant weasel](/compendium/bestiary/beast/giant-weasel.md)) that sits on the giant's lap or shoulder. |
| 2 | The giant swats at a murmuration of starlings as if it were a cloud of gnats. |
| 3 | The giant uses a [dagger](/compendium/items/dagger.md) as a toothpick, a [greatsword](/compendium/items/greatsword.md) as a letter opener, or a pair of [javelins](/compendium/items/javelin.md) as knitting needles. |
| 4 | The giant carefully lifts Humanoids (cradling their heads to avoid injury) to see and hear them better. |
| 5 | The giant exclaims with admiration at the fine detail and exquisite articulation of the characters' armor. |
| 6 | The giant fidgets with the skulls of Humanoids. |
