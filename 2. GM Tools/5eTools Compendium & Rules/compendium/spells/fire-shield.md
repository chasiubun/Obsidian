# Fire Shield
*4th-level, Evocation*  

- **Casting time:** 1 action
- **Range:** Self
- **Components:** V, S, a bit of phosphorus or a firefly
- **Duration:** 10 minute

Thin and wispy flames wreathe your body for the duration, shedding bright light in a 10-foot radius and dim light for an additional 10 feet. You can end the spell early by using an action to dismiss it.

The flames provide you with a warm shield or a chill shield, as you choose. The warm shield grants you resistance to cold damage, and the chill shield grants you resistance to fire damage.

In addition, whenever a creature within 5 feet of you hits you with a melee attack, the shield erupts with flame. The attacker takes `2d8` fire damage from a warm shield, or `2d8` cold damage from a cold shield.
