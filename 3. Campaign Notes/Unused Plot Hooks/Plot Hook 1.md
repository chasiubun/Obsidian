The Lord of (X City) is devising a new invention he wants to have displayed in the next world exhibition. He is looking for a party who can fully make use of this invention, apply it in a variety of circumstances, and showcase it at the following year. The Lord will help the party get registered with a local adventurer's guild and provide feedback with how the invention can be used as aid on the mission.
