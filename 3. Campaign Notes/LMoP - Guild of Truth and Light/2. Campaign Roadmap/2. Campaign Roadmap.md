# Adventure Hook
The party is meeting in Phandalin based on either character background or secondary goals. If the character does not have a goal or reason to be in the city, the characters are contacted by a dward patron and friend, [[gundren-rockseeker-lmop]] to escort a wagon to the Barthen's Provisions in the town for 10gp. 

The party will be attacked by goblins from the cragmaw tribe.
