## Synopsis
Born to a family of hatters and tailors Jervis grew up in a life of luxury. His parents worked among the nobles fitting them with fine and expensive clothes. Jervis grew up learning this trade but in truth this was never his passion. He was rather fond of music, poetry and entertaining others. 

He was soon sneaking off in the night to amaze those in the taverns and inns with his small tricks and musical performances. After a few years of this his parents soon learned of these outings. They became concerned after hearing of these odd performances. His parents hoping to help him sent him to a school in hopes he would soon abandon this desire to perform. This seemed to help for a time. 

At this school he was taught how to use words to influence those around him. Both in positive and negative ways. He soon incorporated these lessons and magic into his performances. However he soon grew bored of these lessons and longed to hear the applause of a crowd. 

He soon met another who he started performing with for a time. This person seemed like an elf but different. They eventually parted ways but the bard left a gift for Jervis but asked him not to open it until they left. He waited as asked, upon opening the box inside was a lute and a book. The book was bound in leather and a raven was emblazoned upon its cover. Within seemed to be poetry but it was of a nature he had never read. It seemed to affect his mind, making him fickle and even more eccentric. He soon packed his bags and has been moving from town to town giving small performances for the last few years.
