## Personality

### Personality Traits
- New to magic; she loves to go on and on about it as her obsession
- She is very possessive about her tools, claiming that if anyone else uses them, it will "ruin the magic"
- Not very imaginative and rather scientific, she talked to the point and uses little imagery or metaphors

### Ideals
- Life should be preserved at all costs, yet suffering is to be expected and permissible
- Talent should be recognized and be allowed to flourish

### Bonds
- Most of her family remains in Sprzeb'do 
- Although leaving the army, she is still regarded well by her old army-mates

### Flaws
- claiming to "see the patterns," she is a particularly bad gambler
- if a person rejects her help, she will be less inclined to do so in the future

## Backstory

[[Nadezhda Plavikamen]]  was unusually big and athletic for a woman, so she decided to become a soldier for her hometown **Spzob'do**. Nadezhda found a particular skill and joy in crafting armor and weapons. She did her job well for the first few years, and eventually joined the vanguards **Cmakoplja** as the head armorer at the young age of 24. 

This was poor timing as a famine came into the lands, thus putting the well-prepared Spzob'do as a target from many raiders and bandits. For that year, there was a threat each week and although not particularly deadly, the work was draining.

During this time, with armor and weapons continuously being worn, Nadezhda poured more of herself in the work of creating quality and long-lasting items. Through study of books and hard work, the weave eventually became revealed to her and she was able to infuse some magic into her work. While medics were there to heal the body, Nadezhda worked hard to prevent injuries from happening in the first place. Her work was hardly recognized except by the most logistically-minded, but it was indispensable. 

Once the famine had passed after a couple of years, and a semblance of peace had come, the lord of the city granted rewards to the soldiers who had performed well in the past years. Nadezhda although not particularly proud did expect some recognition as being *THE* armorer of Cmakoplja and the whole army. Yet, she was passed over.

Seeing that her value would not be recognized in Cmakoplja, and that her pursuit of magic would be discouraged now that the struggle had lessened, she decided to leave the army and her hometown. Nadezhda now works as an adventurer. The life of an adventurer gives her time to hone her magic skills, as well as get the fame and recognition she desires.
