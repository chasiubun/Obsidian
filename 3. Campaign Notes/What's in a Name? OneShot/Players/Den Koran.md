## Backstory

Raised as a monk in distant mountaintop monastaries, [[Den Koran]]  was taught since childbirth that ascetism, self-denial, and discipline were the keys to a truly fulfilled life. The martial arts drilled into him by his masters mixed well with his natural affinity towards the air and sky and he excelled greatly in all that he put his hand to. The only catch was: he hated his life. Waking up in the same drab room every day, putting on the same drab robes, practicing the same katas, such routine monotony was enough to drive a young genasi the point of madness. He was a scion of the Air Genies of ages past! He was not meant to be contained within a secluded temple, he was meant to be free as the wind.

Upon voicing his frustration to his masters, they rebuked him and chastised him, disciplining him with forced isolated meditation. He had enough. Utilizing his innate talents, he fled the monastery (taking as many relics and trinkets as he could) and set forth into the world to experience all that life had to offer.
