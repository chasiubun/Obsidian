## Misc
Limerick:
"It's hard to ignore all the calls
That I wasted my time in the halls
So I guess I'll just shrug, And use mage hand to tug
On my hot delayed blast fire balls"


Have a trap where a spell or effect goes off (maybe even in combat) where all the players consciousness get swapped around and they have to deal with the dungeon as each other.



- Work on [[Ron Thess]], [[Vyras Stratton]], [[Roland Briarfell]] and [[Dyrek Revenmar]] 
- When arriving to Feldon, get Wyn to come inside with Vyras to meet Ron, thinking it's roland. Then have Roland bump into Vandeirn outside and they share a drink together after heading to the tavern
